# mtsat_missing_data
this is just a joke in QC.. it can be changed by making long function from this script, then iterates in one time.
input data involves hierarcy of some directories (as you can modify as you like) and technically the data is written MTS210013123IR1.pgm.gz which is mean MTS2[year(last yy)-month(mm)-day(dd)-hour(hh)]IR1.pgm.gz
